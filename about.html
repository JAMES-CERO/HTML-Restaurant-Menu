          <p>The CEO of  H-Thai-ML
            was working as a chef in San Francisco and trying to find a way to fund his own fine-dining restaurant. So, he decided to open up a small burrito shop in Colorado, a low-risk investment, that could provide the capital for the restaurant he really wanted to run.
           
           “This was going to be one restaurant,” James said on NPR's “How I Built This” podcast in October. “And this was going to be a cash cow that could fund and help support a full-scale restaurant. You know, I knew that full-scale restaurants were a dicey proposition. I mean, they go out of business often. It's hard to make margins, very difficult to operate. And so I wanted H-Thai-ML to be a backup.”
